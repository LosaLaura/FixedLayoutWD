			<p class="privacystatenebt">GORILLAZ PRIVACY POLICY<br>
		Fans make artist careers possible, and data is how artists understand and interact with fans. This privacy policy describes how Gorillaz, including managers, partners, and agents working on our behalf, collects, uses, and shares data. It also describes your rights to control data about you. Legally speaking, GF Corp Limited, Data Protection Number ZB879825 is the “controller” of this data and is primarily responsible for how it is collected, used, and shared.<br>

Gorillaz operates other affiliated companies and brands that may receive and process data about you. Where appropriate, each of these affiliated entities make the disclosures in this privacy policy. Your privacy choices and requests will be applied to all affiliated companies unless we confirm otherwise with you.<br>

The disclosures in this privacy policy cover websites, stores, campaign tools, fan clubs, live events, social media accounts, and similar technologies that are operated by or on behalf of Gorillaz. We refer to all of these together as our “Sites”.<br>

Some platforms or partners we use or link to from the Sites may collect data for their own purposes as controller or joint controller. Those platforms or partners will provide their own privacy policy, which will apply to their collection and use of data collected for their own or joint purposes. We do our best to partner with companies we trust to responsibly handle data about you, but please have a look at these other privacy policies so you understand how those partners will use your data.<br>

We use Warner Music Group to assist with payment processing, fulfillment, and customer support for our online merch store. Because of the way the banking system works, Warner Music Group acts as a “data controller” for payment processing data and uses that data independently in accordance with their privacy policy, located at privacy.wmg.com/ecom/privacy-policy. For everything else, Warner Music Group acts as a service provider and only uses data about you on our behalf.
